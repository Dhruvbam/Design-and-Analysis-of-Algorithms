## About
This repository contains three major projects completed as part of the **CS3364: Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course at Texas Tech University. These projects focus on implementing and analyzing various algorithms to solve complex real-world problems efficiently.

Each project demonstrates a different algorithmic approach, including sorting algorithms, graph traversal algorithms, and shortest path algorithms, applied to specific problem domains. The projects are designed to highlight the power of algorithmic solutions in computer science.

## Projects
This repository contains the following projects:

1. **Project 1: Evaluating Search Engine Reliability through Sorting Algorithms**
    - This project focuses sorting algorithms, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Insertion Sort are applied to assess the reliability of search engines by analyzing inversion counts in the ranking of web pages.
