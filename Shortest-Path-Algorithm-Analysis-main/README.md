# Shortest Path Algorithm Analysis

## Project Overview
Developed for CS 3364: Design and Analysis of Algorithms, this project employs Dijkstra's greedy algorithm and the Bellman-Ford dynamic programming algorithm to determine the shortest path between two locations on a city map. Designed to handle graphs with and without negative edge weights, this analysis provides insights into algorithm efficiency and application in real-world scenarios.

## Problem Statement
The task focuses on calculating the optimal route between two points, addressing the challenge of navigating through a graph that may feature negative edge weights, using Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms.

## Features
- Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for graphs without negative edge weights.
- Utilization of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm for graphs with negative edge weights.
- Analysis of algorithmic efficiency and pathfinding accuracy.

## How to Run
Ensure Python is installed. Execute the main script to see the algorithms in action:
```bash
python project3_final.py
